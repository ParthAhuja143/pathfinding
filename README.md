## About

Pathfinding algorithms are essential tools in various domains, from robotics to video games. This project aims to provide a visual representation of different pathfinding algorithms, allowing users to understand, compare, and analyze their behavior and performance. Whether you're a student learning about algorithms or a developer seeking to optimize your application's pathfinding capabilities, this visualizer can be a valuable educational and practical resource.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid-Based Interface:** Define starting and ending points and add obstacles with an intuitive grid-based user interface.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Witness the pathfinding process in real time as the algorithm navigates through the grid.
- **Multiple Pathfinding Algorithms:** Explore various pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra's Algorithm, A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Bidirectional BFS, Greedy Best-First Search, A*, and also a brand new Riot Algorithm.
- **Convenience Features:** Easily clear paths and obstacles with dedicated buttons.
